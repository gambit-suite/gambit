GAMBIT Documentation
********************


GAMBIT (Genomic Approximation Method for Bacterial Identification and Tracking) is a tool for
rapid taxonomic identification of microbial pathogens. It uses an efficient genomic distance
metric along with a curated database of approximately 50,000 reference genomes (derived from NCBI
`RefSeq`_) to identify genome assemblies from across the Bacterial kingdom in seconds.
